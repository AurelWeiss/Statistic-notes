# Descriptive statistics & explorative data analysis (EDA)
This is a place to store my notes on descriptive statistics and explorative data analysis (short EDA).
- *Descriptive statistics*:
  Dealing with data, summarizing data, and visualizing data.
- *Explorative data analysis (EDA):*
  Understanding data, finding patterns, and visualizing data.

# Installation
Install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r ds_eda_requirements.txt
```
# Usage
The scripts are written in Python and can be run in a Jupyter notebook or in a Python environment.
They are commented and should (hopefully) be easy to follow.
